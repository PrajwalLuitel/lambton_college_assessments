        "Develop a Hangman game in Python using object-oriented programming. This game should progressively display a hangman drawing with each incorrect guess. The player will guess letters in a secret word, with the game tracking and displaying their progress. Additionally, the game will prompt the player for their name and student ID at the start and calculate the total duration of the game at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Game Requirements\n",
        "1. **Player Details:** At the beginning of the game, prompt the player to enter their name and student ID.\n",
        "2. **Secret Word:** Select a word that the player will attempt to guess.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# This is formatted as code\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Display for Guesses:** Initially, show underscores for each letter in the secret word. As the player guesses letters correctly, reveal them in their correct positions.\n",
        "4. **User Guesses:** Allow the player to guess one letter at a time.\n",
        "5. **Check Guesses:** Determine if the guessed letter is part of the secret word.\n",
        "6. **Update Display:** Uncover the correctly guessed letters within the secret word.\n",
        "7. **Hangman Drawing:** Develop a visual representation of the hangman, adding parts with each incorrect guess.\n",
        "8. **Guess Limit:** Set a maximum number of incorrect guesses before the game ends (commonly 6).\n",
        "9. **Game End Conditions:** The game concludes either when the player successfully guesses the secret word or the hangman drawing is complete.\n",
        "10. **Game Duration:** Calculate and display the total duration of the game in seconds at the end.\n",
        "11. **Looping Mechanism:** Utilize loops to keep the game running until an end condition is met.\n",

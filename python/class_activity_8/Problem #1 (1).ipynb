    "# Python Challenge: Word Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with writing a Python function named `word_frequency_analysis` that analyzes the frequency of words in a given text. The function should perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Convert the entire text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive processing.\n",
    "   - Remove any characters that are not alphabetic or spaces (to ensure only words are processed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Word Extraction:**\n",
    "   - Using a while loop, iterate through the preprocessed text to extract individual words.\n",
    "   - Words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Frequency Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Use a dictionary to track the frequency of each word encountered.\n",
    "   - The keys in the dictionary should be the unique words, and the corresponding values should be the counts of those words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unique Letter Count:**\n",
    "   - For each word, also calculate the number of unique letters it contains.\n",
    "   - Store this information in another dictionary where each word is a key, and the value is the count of unique letters in that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Data:**\n",
    "   - The function should return a tuple containing two elements:\n",
    "     - The first element is the word frequency dictionary.\n",
    "     - The second element is the dictionary with counts of unique letters in each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** `\"Hello, world! Hello, everyone.\"`\n",
    "- **Output:** `({'hello': 2, 'world': 1, 'everyone': 1}, {'hello': 4, 'world': 5, 'everyone': 6})`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider using the `.replace()` method to handle unwanted characters during preprocessing.\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop to iterate through the text for word extraction.\n",
    "- Utilize a `set` to easily calculate the number of unique letters in each word.\n",
    "- Pay attention to edge cases, such as texts with no alphabetic characters or multiple consecutive spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will test your ability to manipulate strings, iterate with control structures, and effectively use collections like dictionaries and sets. Good luck!\n"
